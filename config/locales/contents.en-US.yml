          <p>Airesis is an open source decision-making tool for e-democracy, strongly oriented to problem-solving and designed to maximize the immense evolutionary power of <a heref="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence" target="_blank">collective intelligence</a>.</p> <p>Entirely developed by volunteers according to non-profit principles, Airesis was created to take faster, informed, shared and participated decisions.<br/> It is based on the following principles:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Participation</strong> <br/> Involving citizens means having more energy and points of view available. Only through direct participation it is possible to investigate the problems and understand what people really want. Participation is the essence of democratic decisions. </li> <li><strong>Transparency and Security</strong><br/> Without transparency, rules can be easily circumvented and democracy can quickly degenerate. Transparency also means openness, ability to receive: for this reasons Airesis also allows unregistered users to view the contents of the site. The source code of the software is also "transparent", being it entirely open source.</li> <li><strong>Constructive dialogue</strong><br/> No one owns all the right answers. Using appropriate tools, elaborating ideas proposed by many people can be more productive than doing it yourself.</li> <li><strong>Equal opportunities</strong><br/> To be intended as how effective equality, in terms of offered possibilities, can be pursued by the system. </li> <li><strong>Flexibility</strong><br/> Each group has its own needs, each proposal is different from the others, each user has their own needs.</li>
